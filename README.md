### Elesto agent

The [Elesto Protocol]() is a Decentralized Key Management System (DKMS) which needs agents to implement certain protocols to allow the project to leverage [SSI]()

## Key Characteristics

- A blockchain interface layer (known as a resolver) for creating and signing blockchain transactions.
- A resolver can be seen as part of a larger component known as the [VDR]():
  > Aries Verifiable Data Registry Interface: An interface for verifying data against an underlying ledger.
- A cryptographic wallet that can be used for secure storage of cryptographic secrets and other information (the secure storage tech, not a UI) used to build blockchain clients.
- An encrypted messaging system for allowing off-ledger interaction between those clients using multiple transport protocols.
- An implementation of ZKP-capable W3C verifiable credentials using the ZKP primitives found in Ursa.
- An implementation of the Decentralized Key Management System (DKMS) specification currently being incubated in under the name Elesto by AllinBits.
- A mechanism to build higher-level protocols and API-like use cases based on the secure messaging functionality.
